## The Code

In our Grading code it first takes the name of the user, the current grade they have in the class and the weight of the final grade of the class. Then it takes their desired final grade within the class. With this information, it computes back to the user the grade needed on the final to recieve the grade the user wants, and provides commentary on how difficult achieving that test grade may be.


## Installing the Code

To download this code, make sure you have the url copied from the GitHub page of the repository. Then go to your command terminal and access your desired directory where you want the code to exist. Then use the `git clone` command followed by the url link you copied to install the software.


## Running the Code (Usage Documentation)

Open the code in JupyterHub and run the kernel. When the program asks for a grade or a percentage, do not enter a decimal number unless it accurately represents the weighted percentage. For example, if your current grade is a 90%, your final is worth 10%, and you want to finish the class with a 93%, you would input the values as shown below:

+ What is your current grade in your class? *90*
+ What percent of your grade is your final worth? *10*
+ What is your desired final grade? *93*

Note that there are no percent signs accompanying the values, and 10% is represented as 10 rather than .10.


## Contributing to the Code

If you wish to make changes on the code, fork the repository and edit the python file. When your work is complete, save it by using the `git add .`, `git commit`, and `git push origin main` commands and then submit a pull request. We will then review your code and your contributions.


## Code of Conduct

The Code of Conduct that we decided to abide by is the Contributor Covenant. It is attached in a markdown file for all who download this code to read and follow. This CoC was chosen because it allows for anyone and everyone to freely contribute and add to this code without fear of judgement or harassment. All are welcome, and everyone should feel safe to contribute to projects like this one. We feel that the Contributor Covenant supports this notion and allows for the codebase to thrive under this system.


## License

We chose to license this code under the GNU General Public License. This ensures that the source code is always public and also lets any user freely change and share the code in an open source environment.
