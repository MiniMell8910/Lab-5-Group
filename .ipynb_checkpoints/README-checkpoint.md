## The Code

In our Grading code it first takes the name of the user, the current grade they have in the class and the weight of the final grade of the class. Then it takes their desired final grade within the class. With this information, it computes back to the user the grade needed on the final to recieve the grade the user wants, and provides commentary on how difficult achieving that test grade may be.


## Running the Code

Open the code in JupyterHub and run the kernel. When the program asks for a grade or a percentage, do not enter a decimal number unless it accurately represents the weighted percentage. For example, if your current grade is a 90%, your final is worth 10%, and you want to finish the class with a 93%, you would input the values as shown below:

+ What is your current grade in your class? **90**
+ What percent of your grade is your final worth? **10**
+ What is your desired final grade? **93**

Note that there are no percent signs accompanying the values, and 10% is represented as 10 rather than .10.
